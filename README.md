# **REPO_NAME**

Template for python-based repositories.

## Usage

1. Use this repository by specifying it as a template for your repository.
2. Replace the **REPO_NAME** placeholders with the name of your repository (replace "-" with "\_"). For example if you create a repo called "my-repo" you should replace **REPO_NAME** with "my_repo".
   - You should replace the placeholders in the following files:
     - README.md
     - pyproject.toml (and run `poetry install` after replacing the placeholders)
     - **REPO_NAME** folder
